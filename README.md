## 📖 What is roboreplay?

roboreplay is a simple tool that helps you record what your robot does, then replay those actions to find out what happened. It works with robots that use Python programming. You can use it to see if something goes wrong or to study how your robot behaves. This helps you fix problems or improve your robot’s performance.

roboreplay supports many common robot simulators and tools, making it easy to use no matter what robotics setup you have.
